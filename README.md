ðŸ“Œ Explanation of Each Step

âœ… Decision Tree (Classification/Regression)
Choose dataset with either classification or regression target.

Preprocess and split data into train-test.

Train a Decision Tree model.

Control overfitting by limiting depth, leaf size, etc.

Visualize the tree to understand splits and decisions.

Evaluate accuracy using test data.

Interpret feature importance from the model.

âœ… Random Forest (Ensemble of Trees)
Start with same steps as decision tree (data loading & splitting).

Train a Random Forest model (multiple decision trees).

Avoid overfitting using bagging and randomness.

Compare accuracy with single decision tree.

Check feature importances to see which features are most useful.

Validate model using cross-validation.
